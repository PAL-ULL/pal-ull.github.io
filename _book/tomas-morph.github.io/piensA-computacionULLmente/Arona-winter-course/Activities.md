# Computational thinking everywhere: also in travel and tourism

ICT stands for information and communication technologies. There is a huge amount of material that describes and explains aspects of ICT: books, magazines and Web pages, and radio and TV programmes. To develop insights into the future of ICT, it is worth regularly scanning a wide range of publications - from lifestyle magazines to science reports.

As a professional you will be able to use these documents in a variety of ways and for a variety of purposes, such as:

* personal development
* supporting your case for a technical project proposal
* explaining your particular ICT specialism to a non-expert or the converse of this - understanding what an ICT expert is telling you about something or for demonstrating your personal expertise.

A definition of ICT is:

the catch-all phrase used to describe a range of technologies for gathering, storing, retrieving, processing, analysing and transmitting information. Advances in ICT have progressively reduced the costs of managing information, enabling individuals and organisations to undertake information-related tasks much more efficiently, and to introduce innovations in products, processes and organisational structures.

People often assume that ICT means 'computers', or that 'computers' means ICT. In fact, ICT is much bigger than just computers, which are usually only one part of an ICT system - usually the part that stores the information or facilitates the flow of communication.

An ICT system is a collection of independent elements that combine to achieve a pre-determined objective. 

Tourism and travel include professional skills such as:

* Managing Performance Through People 
* Effective Leadership Skills 
* Managing Organisation Performance and 
* Applying Strategic Thinking.
* IT and Travel Planning. 

The aim of the following activities is for you to work interactively on the development of a travel plan. 
This is simulated in a scrtach exercise that particularly focuses on blending travel plan measures to reduce journeys. 

# Computer Science Unplugged

CS Unplugged is a collection of free learning activities that teach Computer Science through engaging games and puzzles that use cards, string, crayons and lots of running around. We originally developed this so that young students could dive head-first into computer science, experiencing the kinds of questions and challenges that computer scientists experience, but without having to learn programming first.

The collection was originally intended as a resource for outreach and extension, but with the adoption of computing and computational thinking into many classrooms around the world, it is now widely used for teaching.

# Code.org

Launched in 2013, Code.org® is a non-profit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science by making it available in more schools, and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color. Our vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science. We believe computer science and computer programming should be part of the core curriculum in education, alongside other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses, such as biology, physics, chemistry and algebra.

We're proud to offer all of our curriculum and course content completely free worldwide, without any sort of needed partnership to use our materials in your school or organization! You can find our curriculum in full at curriculum.code.org. We also offer professional development opportunities for K-12 teachers through either 1-day or multi-phase workshops. You can read more about these opportunities here.

# Scratch

With Scratch, you can program your own interactive stories, games, and animations — and share your creations with others in the online community.

Scratch helps young people learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively — essential skills for life in the 21st century.

Scratch is a project of the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. It is provided free of charge.
