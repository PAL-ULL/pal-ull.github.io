**Introduction to computational thinking**

The material in this module is organised around video clips from a presentation that Wing gave in 2009 entitled ‘Computational Thinking and Thinking About Computing’ (Wing, 2009). The presentation builds on Wing’s influential 2006 ‘Computational Thinking’ paper in which she set out to ‘spread the joy, awe, and power of computer science, aiming to make computational thinking commonplace’ (Wing, 2006, p. 35).

**Algorithms, Abstraction and computational problems**

To state more precisely what computational thinking is, we need to consider the ideas of an algorithm and a computational problem. We will think about these ideas in some activities. Although Wing deals in great detail with the idea of abstraction as modelling, she only hints at the concept of abstraction as encapsulation. Both are, however, at play in computing. Distinguishing between them will give you a better understanding of the remainder of Wing’s story.

**Computational thinking everywhere. Also in travel and tourism**

Computational thinking has led to exciting developments and discoveries in a number of fields. This has caused a demand for people with computational thinking skills to move these fields forward even further. In this section, you will encounter some of these applications of computational thinking in travel and tourism.
