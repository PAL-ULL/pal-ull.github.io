# Conclusions

## What is Computer Science?

CS is the **study of the theory**, **experimentation**, and **engineering** that form the basics for the **design and use of computers**.

CS is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information.

CS includes, among other activities:

 * Design and development of digital systems
 * **Computational thinking**
 * Computer programming

## What is Information and Communications Technology (ICT)?

ICTs are theoretical-conceptual tools, supports and channels that process, store, synthesize, recover and present information in the most varied way.

The tools have evolved over time: Computers & Internet

The use of ICTs represents a remarkable variation in society and in the long term, an important change in education, in interpersonal relationships and in the way of disseminating and generating knowledge.

## What Computer Science isn’t? 

There are multiple activities related to the use of computers that are usually considered as part of CS, but they aren’t really:

  * Digital literacy or skills
  * Online security
  * Electronics and robotics
  * Use of ICT for education and learning
